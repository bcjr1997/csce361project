CSCE 361 Team 4 - HamsterHelp

The system starts from launching the application from the application launcher in Android. The application will display a login page
that allows user to login or register for a new account. 


REGISTRATION AND LOGIN
For new registration, the user will have to click the registration link located at the bottom of the application. The registration 
link will redirect the user to the registration page where user information is required. The information required are First Name, Last
Name, Date of Birth (DOB), Mobile Number, Address Line 1, Address Line 2, Email address, Password, and the selection between "Here to Help!" 
and "I need Help!" in the dropdown menu.
After registering for an account, the user will be brought back to the login page and the user can login to the application with the 
registered account. Information required for logins are Email address and Password. After logging in, the application will be redirected to 
the homepage with searching methods to choose and display of information of the current helper with a Call Helper button at the bottom of 
the screen.


MATCHING WITH USERS
The user can choose between matching with helpers or people who needs help with 2 methods, Tag and Email. Selecting the TAG button will 
redirect the application to the tag searching page where the user can choose between "Here to Help!" and "I need Help!" tags to display 
the list of registered users (depending on their tags when registering) with the number of user rating and the average rating. The user 
can click on the user on the result list to redirect to the User Data page of the selected user, displaying the First and Last name, Email,
and Mobile number. This page also allows user to rate the selected user. This page allows the user to match with selected user by clicking 
the Buddify! button located at the bottom of the screen. After clicking Buddify!, the application will redirect back to the homepage with 
the updated information on the Current HamsterBuddy: and HamsterBuddy's Phone Number.

The user can also search the HamsterBuddy by email address and the application will redirect to the User Data page directly just like the 
Tag search.
